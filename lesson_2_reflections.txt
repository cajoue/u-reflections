What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A empty hidden git folder is created. It is necessary to hold the meta data
	of the commits that will be created in the (now) git repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	It's a holding area for the names of files that you want to track, it doesn't
	have files as such.

	The value is that you can decide how to manage the logical tracking of files
	by grouping similar elements together in a logical commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	You add the files that were specifically targeted in that logical step and
	ignore irrelevant ones

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	When you want to trial an alternative feature (easy-mode)
	Add an experimental feature
	Add a new language version to see if it works

	Branches would help to keep the variations away from the master code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	It helps to clarify the history path and how different paths relate to each
	other - or not!

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
