When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    If you were working from a different computer or contributing commentary
    to someone else's remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Then you can choose what to pull. If the changes was a contribution from
    another person, you would want to know what it is first and decide for
    yourself whether to accept it or not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branch- copies a branch (master in the first instance) so that can work on
    other features: experimental, bug fixes etc, without affecting the
    official default branch.

    Clone- this is a copy of a repo that you work on locally. You can copy it
    from GitHub to local, or copy another local repo. You can clone your repo
    to multiple computers.

    Fork- this is a clone made in GitHub. It is the preferred way to clone
    someone else's repo. You will have your own version and any changes won't
    affect the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
